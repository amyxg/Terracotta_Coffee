Working files:

<strong>1. Homepage </strong>

- Logo, tabs (menu, sign in, rewards), advertisement of current coffee/plant of the 
month
- Purpose: allows users to see the idea of what the business is, what we sell, why we 
started this business. This allows users to also see tabs that show what business 
offers. Since this is the first user experience for customers, itâ€™ll allow users to get a 
good first impression

<strong>2. Login/Register </strong>

- Includes form to sign in (email/password)
- Purpose: provides users/admin a log in feature to see personal information (reward 
points, past orders, CC updated information if needed, etc). This increases business 
interaction and give users a sense of loyalty to the business. This also helps provides
the business to access their email/phone for marketing purposes, if they agree to 
terms of conditions. 
  
<strong>4. Rewards </strong>
